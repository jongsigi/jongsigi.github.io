## Importance of Recording

"It takes a lot of energy to live properly," says the owner of a top K-pop agency.<br>

I deeply resonate with this statement. When I tried to deploy my Python code to AWS, I faced issues with Python versions and library installations. Like many others, I searched error codes and attempted fixes. However, I just struggled in the vast world of the internet without finding a solution.<br>

Because I didn’t organize my chaotic situation, I couldn’t reach a solution. I kept pressing copy and paste on my keyboard. If you’re in trouble, don’t try to solve the problem directly. Reflect on the root cause and how to address it, and make sure to record your journey. This preparation will help when you encounter similar problems in the future.
