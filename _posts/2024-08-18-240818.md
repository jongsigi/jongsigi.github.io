## Accept Other's Review

When I program my survey web page. I try to learn and use some technique to look my website good. But Actually important thing is how user feels. Not depends on how much time I spend for that function. <br>

With my head, I understand. But when it comes to reality, I try to defense every single review with my effort for making that function. Then, user quit to give me pure advice. <br>

I know it's really hard for taking other review that says my web page looks bad or not easy to use. But if they feel like that, I need to change my web page. Not trying to persuade user.
