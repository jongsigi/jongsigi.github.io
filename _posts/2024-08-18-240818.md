## Accept Others' Reviews

When I was programming my survey web page, I tried to learn and use various techniques to make my website look good. However, the most important thing is how the user feels, not how much time I spent on a particular function.<br>

In theory, I understand this. But in practice, I tend to defend every single review, justifying the effort I put into creating each feature. As a result, users stop giving me honest feedback.<br>

I know it's really hard to accept reviews that say my web page looks bad or is not easy to use. But if users feel that way, I need to change my web page, not try to persuade them otherwise.
