We don't fully understand, or at least there are multiple definitions of the winning and losing means. There are two types of game:there are finite game and there are infinite games. 

A finite game is defined as having know player, fixed rules and agreed-upon objective. In football, we all agree on the rules before we begin play. We agree that whoever has more points at the end of the set time period is the winner. The game has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

In an infinite game, there are know and unknown players, the rules are changeable, and the objective is to perpetuate the game or stay in the game.

So now this gets me thinking about other contexts in the world in which we live:business, politics, even education. Right? Which is, what game are playing? 

In business, there's no such thing as winning. There's no such thing as winning in global politics, and there's definitely no such thing as winning in education. 

But if we listen to the language too many organizations, they don't know the game they're in. They talk about being the best, they talk about being number one, and they talk about beating their competition...
