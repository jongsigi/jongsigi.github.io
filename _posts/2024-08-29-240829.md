## Do Whatever You Like

The advice I would give to any entrepreneur is: do not chase the hot new thing, whatever it is. It's incredibly difficult to catch something that everyone already knows is hot.

### Instead, Position Yourself and Wait for the Wave to Come to You

Position yourself in something that captures your curiosity, something you are truly passionate about.<br>

When we acquire companies, I always try to determine: "Is the person leading this company a missionary or a mercenary?" I don't like the mercenary mindset or culture.<br>

A missionary builds a product or service because they love the customer, love the product, and love the service.<br>

A mercenary, on the other hand, builds a product or service just to flip the company and make money. One of the great paradoxes is that missionaries end up making more money than mercenaries anyway.
