## Not Only Making But Also Think about Strategy

Today, it's already September. I plan to launch my product in September. Because I think it's enough to people use and send their result to each other. <br>

At the same time, I worry what if people do not use it. And they do not interest in their skintype and skincare routine. <br>

So I think the product and strategy will progress at the same timeline to avoid failure. Not only studying Front-end programming knowledge to make our skincare-routine-suggestion-page, but also make plan for how to re-edit the weight of survey answer or when to lauch each function and why function lauch order is like that.

* Making 
  * [August] Survey
  * [September] Routine Suggestion
  * [October] Personal Routine and Tracker ...
* Planning Strategy
  *  Modify weight for each question based on User Result
  *  Is this a feature worth User using and sharing?
  *  Why is the feature release schedule ordered like that?

## Today Video : Focus on Stable Thing

This is interview from Jeff Bezos (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/KXGXU4ROy4o) <br>

I very frequently get the question. What's gonna change in the next 10 years? And that is interesting question and very common one.<br>

But I almost never get the question. **What's not going to change in the next 10 years.**<br>

And I submmit to you the second question is actually the more important of the two.<br>

Because when you build the business strategy around the things that are stable in the time. <br>

In a retail business, we know the customer want low prices. And I know it's gonna be truth next 10 years from now. <br>

They want the fast delivery. They want vast selection. <br>

It's impossible to imagine the future 10 years from now where a customer comes up to me and says "Jeff I love Amazon, I just wish prices were a little higher."<br>

You know how you "I love the Amazon, I just wish delivered little more slowly. Impossible!<br>

And so effort that we put those into things, spinning things up. We know that energy we put into it today, will still be paying dividends for our customer next 10 years from now.
