## Do Not Pretend as an Expert

In my journey into the skincare business, I'm not an expert in either skincare or programming. So, I'm in the position of a learner. However, the idea that I'm entering a business area where others may not have ventured (even if that assumption might be wrong) sometimes makes me act like an expert. But the truth is, I'm not an expert in this field. If I want to succeed in the skincare market, I need to continuously learn about the industry.<br>

### Throughout my life, I’ve often liked to pretend I’m an expert, like a peacock spreading its wings.

Today, I want to make a promise to myself not to continue this behavior. That’s why I’m writing this diary entry—to remind myself not to act this way.<br>

It may not directly relate to what I want to say, but there’s a quote I like:<br>

### "If you pretend to have something you don't have, you will lose it."

Be humble, and don’t forget this.
