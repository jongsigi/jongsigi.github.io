I think I finish making my website for my first business. But I'm afraid how to do marketing for people to use my website.

From that time, I read some article that reflect my situation. 

People become addicted to the state of possibility. Most people want to stay in a state of possibility. So, I try my best to avoid having my abilities objectively evaluated. This is because it is more comfortable to be in a state of possibility than to become a person who is not as good as the moment you are evaluated.

I think this sentence describe me as real. So in a week, I will deploy my website to the public.
