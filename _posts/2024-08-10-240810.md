## I Don’t Want to Be an Engineer

I spent 2 days learning Next.js. Since I have experience with programming in React, I thought it would be easy. However, it required more effort than I anticipated because I needed to link it with the Flask server I had built before. This meant I had to understand how Next.js works and then adapt my project to fit its structure.<br>

I don’t want to become a front-end programmer. My goal is simply to create a Baumann-type survey site and then expand it into the cosmetic area. So, I decided to give up on Next.js programming for now. Instead, I searched for a CSS template that fits my survey needs because I only require four types of HTML files. I believe this is a more time-efficient approach.<br>

Maybe next month, I’ll switch to the Next.js format to expand the website. But my first goal is to launch the site. For anyone who wants to follow a similar path, I suggest choosing the most time-efficient method for you. There are many ways to accomplish your ideas, so don’t waste time on fancy methods. Just follow the fastest way that works for you; I believe this is the mindset of business.
