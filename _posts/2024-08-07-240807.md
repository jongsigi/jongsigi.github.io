## Focus on What You Really Want to Service

If you have a full-time job, you can only use your free time after work. Theoretically, that gives you about 2-3 hours per day. In an average week, this adds up to around 10 hours on weekdays and 16 hours on the weekend, totaling 26 hours per week and 104 hours per month. You need to make something valuable in that time, and it may seem like a tough task.<br>

To maximize your productivity, it's important to leverage well-made tools and resources for your projects. However, finding and learning to use these tools can also be time-consuming. I believe it’s helpful to use your free time at work for your future growth. That’s why I always try to align my work with my future goals, even if they seem different at first. For example, I use Python for data analysis at my company, and this coding skill helps me with my personal projects outside of work.<br>

Now, I have almost finished the functional aspects of my survey form using Python Flask and SQLite. However, I lack design skills. This weekend, I plan to learn how to use shadcn/ui for my project. After that, I’ll launch the survey on Vercel (maybe). Finally, I’ll review this project and create a one-page plan as if I were starting the project from scratch. This will help me create a rough guideline or manual for my next project.
