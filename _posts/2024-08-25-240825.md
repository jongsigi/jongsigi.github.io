## Importance of Listening

There are many reasons why people start a business. The main reason, I believe, is that it provides a way to express their thoughts and influence the world according to their own ideas. This often leads to a strong ego or gonzo, which can make it easy to ignore what others have to say.<br><br>

People generally prefer to talk about their own ideas rather than listen to others. Those with strong egos or gonzo might feel an even greater need to express their thoughts, more so than the average person. However, I think this approach is not helpful in the early stages of a business. While it may conflict with their natural tendencies, listening is more beneficial for long-term success than simply speaking or trying to persuade potential users of your ideas.
