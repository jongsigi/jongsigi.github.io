Same as my yesterday video, I need to answer myself why I want to start skincare business and what is the my final imagination for this business. 
- How does people's skincare enviroment change after my business?
- Does people really want that change?

## Are you passionate?

This is interview from Jensen Huang (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/jtL5yPGJs5M) <br>

Money is the only singular reason not to start the company. Because starting company it's a very very unlikely probability for success. <br>

And so that is the reason for doing it, you will likely regret the experience. You should start the company and build the company, **because you so believe in the idea, you are so passion about it and you want to build something great.**

I have plenty of money. But it doesn't motivate me, nor does it demotivate me. So I would urge you to ask yourself and for your friends ask themselves **what is the purpose that they want to start the company.**

You have to perspective that is unique.
