## It’s Just a Side Project

It’s just a side project. That’s the reason why I always delay my projects. I tend to do this often and never achieve a truly satisfying result. I stop working on things when I feel like I’ve done enough, regardless of other people’s reactions.<br>

I think it would be helpful to create a Gantt chart for each side project. This could prevent me from stopping before achieving tangible results. For my second project, I’ll make a chart and share what changes I notice after using it for planning.<br>

As for my first project, it’s almost finished because I only need to code the CSS files for three HTML pages. It’s not that difficult, but I don’t think the result will look very professional. I’m also concerned about how to share my work with others, which is another aspect of business that I need to consider.
